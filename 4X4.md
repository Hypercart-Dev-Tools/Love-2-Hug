## Bonus: Project Scope Outline

> **Note:** This section is a work-in-progress and is being developed as a natural extension of the 4x4 methodology. It is not yet a core part of the framework but is included here as a supplementary tool for teams who want to add more context to their planning.

### 1. Goals
Define the overarching objectives for the project. What are you trying to achieve?

### 2. Assumptions
List any assumptions, including low to high-end time estimates, that influence your planning.

### 3. Potential Risks
Identify risks that could impact the project and consider mitigation strategies.

### 4. Long-Term Maintainability
Evaluate how the project will be maintained over time. Are there any technical debts or sustainability concerns to address?
